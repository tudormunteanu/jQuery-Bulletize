Bulletize will convert a <select> into a list of bullets, each bullet representing an <option> inside the <select>. This can be used to make forms easier to fill in.

Events can still be binded to the <select>, for example .change(). I have used the change() event on one of our projects to load trough AJAX a different section of the page, based on what option has been selected.

By default each bullet will display the label of each option ( the text between <option></option> ). There are 2 ways to control the display:

    * showLabel ( by default is true ) - this triggers the display of the label
    * showIndexNo ( by default is false ) - when this is true, it displays a number inside the bullet. This number is the position of the option.
